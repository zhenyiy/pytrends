New!
====

Theoretically gtrends now supports python 3.4 and 3.5, as well as 2.7. You can also specify the geographical location, timezone, category, and type of search desired. If there are any issues let me know in the issue tracker! Now read on...

About
=====

gtrends is a Python library that eases the process of downloading Google Trend data. `Google Trends <http://www.google.com/trends>`_ is a service offered by Google which allows access to aggregate query volume data for specific search terms, over specific periods of time. This volume data is represented as a fraction of the total query volume on the given day or week.

Users with Google accounts can download these data into csv files, however there are several caveats which make the data difficult to process. The data only come in daily granularity up until 3 months worth of data, after which they become weekly. Even worse, Google normalizes the data, so that the largest percent query volume in the time series is set to an integer '100,' with all other values set to smaller integer values. This makes it difficult, for example, to collect several files and splice them together (such as to maintain a daily granularity via files of shorter time periods), since the data are on difference scales.

gtrends solves this by allowing developers to extract data with either weekly or daily granularity, with the same scaling throughout, without the need to worry over scaling and data manipulation themselves.

Usage
=====

gtrends only contains two functions, the primary one being ``collectTrends()``. It can be used by the following::

	import datetime
	import gtrends

	username = "myGoogleUsername"
	password = "myGooglePassword"

	terms = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
	startDt = datetime.datetime(year=2015, month=1, day=1)
	endDt = datetime.datetime(year=2015, month=2, day=1)

	trends = gtrends.collectTrends(username, password, terms, startDt, endDt)


``collectTrends()`` returns a 2d list of the data, of format [datetime, val0, val1, val2, etc.], with an additional a header. For example, the above code snippet returns the list, ``trends``, as follows::

	date,foo,bar,baz
	1/1/2015,16.667,83.333,16.667
	1/2/2015,16.667,83.333,16.667
	1/3/2015,16.667,83.333,16.667
	1/4/2015,16.667,83.333,16.667
	1/5/2015,16.667,66.667,16.667
	1/6/2015,16.667,66.667,16.667
	1/7/2015,16.667,83.333,16.667
	1/8/2015,16.667,83.333,16.667
	1/9/2015,16.667,83.333,16.667
	1/10/2015,16.667,83.333,16.667

	...

	1/30/2015,16.667,83.333,16.667
	1/31/2015,16.667,100.00,16.667

The dates are of type datetime, and the numbers are floats rounded to 3 decimal places.
The data is normalized across the entire time period and between terms such that the largest value has a float of 100.0, and all other values are scaled accordingly.
Data is returned from [startDt, endDt), to the accuracy of the month (i.e. the specific day within the month does not matter).


Advanced Usage
==============
Granularity
-----------
With the optional argument ``granularity``, the granularity can be changed from the default of daily, to weekly. ``granularity`` takes a string of either ``'d'`` or ``'w'`` corresponding to daily or weekly, respectively.


Sum & SavePath
--------------
``sum``, is an optional argument of type boolean. With this, the data of multiple terms can be summed together into one column. Default is ``False``.``savePath`` takes a string for a path to save the resultant csv. If left as the default ``None``, no file is saved.

Advanced Usage Example
----------------------
::

	import datetime
	import gtrends

	username = "myGoogleUsername"
	password = "myGooglePassword"

	terms = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
	startDt = datetime.datetime(year=2015, month=1, day=1)
	endDt = datetime.datetime(year=2015, month=2, day=1)

	trends = gtrends.collectTrends(username, password, terms, startDt, endDt,
			granularity='w', sum=True, savePath="myDir/data.csv")

Other Specifications
-----------
Just like on the Trends site, you can specify the location, category, type of search, and time zone for which you'd like to collect data. These are all strings corresponding to the respective fields ``geo``, ``cat``, ``gprops``, and ``tz``. For example, to get the query data for the term "pizza" in Italy, in the "Food & Drink" category, in the "news" search for Tajikistan Time, I'd type:
::
	trends = gtrends.collectTrends(username, password, terms, startDt, endDt, geo='IT', cat='0-71', gprops='news', tz='Asia/Dushanbe')

Note: when you select a type of search (gprops) other than the default, you can only search weekly data. That's just how Google is.


Raw Data
========
The secondary function ``collectRawTrends()`` allows you to collect the raw csv from Google Trends as a string::

	import datetime
	import gtrends

	username = "myGoogleUsername"
	password = "myGooglePassword"

	terms = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
	startDt = datetime.datetime(year=2015, month=1, day=1)
	endDt = datetime.datetime(year=2015, month=2, day=1)

	trends = gtrends.collectRawTrends(username, password, terms, startDt, endDt,
			savePath="myDir/data.csv")

In this case, the granularity cannot be set: it is daily or weekly based on what Google naturally returns. The number of terms is limited to 5 (which is the max Google itself allows per csv file) and sumation is not supported (as in the optional argument ``sum`` in ``collectTrends()``). In addition, the regional data and related term data is included, rather than being discarded in ``collectTrends()``.
